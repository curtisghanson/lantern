TAGS
----

Tags are structured sets of keywords used to describe a medium, such as a media
file, collection, entity, playlist, and more.

Tags can have both parent/child relationships as well as sibling relationships.
With sibling relationships, tags have a common attribute shared among them. For
example: `mood:dark` and `mood:somber`. A sibling relationship is given a score
between 0.01 and 1.00. A score of 0.00 would indicate no relationship and
therefore would not have a relationship. Sibling relationships are not used for
normal operations. They are used for assisting in defining how closely one
medium is to another in a library (useful in creating recommendations).

The majority of tags are defined in the application an CANNOT be altered.
Users can, however, define their own tags or simply set which tags they do
not want to use or see from lantern. Tags definitions are made by contributing
to lanterndb.com. From the site, contributors can submit requests for new tags
and many other aspects of media which funnel down into lantern servers.

Also note that each tag is also has a `locale` defined. Any tag with an
alternate name due to a locale should NOT have a sibling defined. This
relationship is handled by the lantern application.
